# Automated-Scripts
The repository contains automation scripts which can be used to automate your go-to works or boring stuffs<br>

<b>[1. DockerSetup.py](https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Automated-Scripts/blob/master/SetupDocker.py)</b><br>
In this python file I have created a script which will automatically download and configure the docker in your system. This is only for linux operating systems. <br>

<b>NOTE :</b> I have not used the concepts of error handling but soon will add some use-cases in the script for better performance.<br>

<b>[2. NmapScanner.py](https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Automated-Scripts/blob/master/NmapScanner.py)</b><br>
In this python script I have used the concepts of conditional statements and commands of nmap. This script I have created just to enhance my skills and recall the concepts of nmap-scanner. It consists of 10 different types of nmap scans for which we need to remember the commands but this script will help me to just launch the scans without mugging up the commands for every other task.

<b>NOTE :</b> I haven't checked for the all the tasks mentioned in the menu. So if any ERROR comes please dm me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhinavdubey26/">LinkedIn Profile</a>.<br>

<b>[3. ImageNaming.py](https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Automated-Scripts/blob/master/ImageNaming.py)</b><br>
In this python file I have created a auto-naming script which I use to filter the data for training espically to work with images. you just need to mention the directory path in which images are present and it will satrting naming those images in a proper way. By default it will satrt with 1.jpg, 2.jpg,... and so on. It can useful for such use cases. I have used the OS module of Python for creating this.<br>

<b>[4. MailSender.py](https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Automated-Scripts/blob/master/MailSender.py)</b><br>
In this python file I have created a mail-sending script. I have used the concpets of smtp server to create this script. I use this script to send automated mails where-ever needed in my projects. To send mail just give the reciptent mail ID and it will automatically send the mail. Also at the place of usermail and password, enter your usermail and password of gmail account.<br>

<b>NOTE :</b> I would suggest to use environment variables instead of directly using your MailID and Password, as I used because it is more convinient way as well as more secure way to use such scripts.


<b>[5. PgBackup.sh](https://github.com/Abhinav-26/Automated-Scripts/blob/master/pg_backup.sh)</b><br>
I have created a shell script which migrates the database on schema level from one database instance to another without any downtime. This also takes a quick snapshot of the entire contents of the DB and stores in for later needs for disaster recovery needs.<br>

<b>NOTE :</b> I would suggest to use environment variables instead of directly using your Database credentials, as I used because it is more convinient way.
